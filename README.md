Car Club Council of Hampton Roads Website

This is a website that my brother and I built from the ground up. We have experience in HTTP5, CSS3, and Javascript from our schooling experience. We are using this website to expand our skills and learn new ones, while at the same time giving back to a non-profit organization that gives to the community in charitable donations.

We have had a few versions of this project so far, but seeing as how this is my first experience with version control and git/github in particular, we will label this inital upload as version 1.0.

**--Version 1.0--**

Basic site is constructed with recognizable header, navigation, banner, content, and footer sections.

Site is constructed in a responsive manner; to make the experience enjoyable for desktop, mobile, and tablet users.

Footer constructed to be in a 'sticky' footer style in order to expand the body wrapper to the bottom of the page.

Banner utilizes Javascript in order to rotate the pictures as well as the URL associated with clicking on each of the images.

Navagation utilizes Javascript as well as CSS properties to facilitate dropdown buttons.

**--Known Issues--**

Nav buttons: Javascript needs to be reworked. Dropdown buttons stay "dropped" when another dropdown is clicked/pressed.

Nav buttons: Touching anywhere below the navigation bar in iOS does not cancel the drop down.
